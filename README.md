# Week6-Homework2

An upgraded version of the course's random tilemap ganerator, which contains a random position generetor for the player that implements the following rules:
1. The player can't be on the wall (i. e. mountains in this map)
2. The player must have at least 100 tiles that he can reach (implemented with the BFS code that was showed in class)
